Title: Functions to simplify the creation of choropleths (thematic maps) in R.
Description: Choropleth maps are thematic maps where certain regions (e.g.
    states) are colored according a certain criteria (e.g. population count).  The most
    famous choropleth in the USA is probably the presidential voting
    choropleth, where states that voted voted for the Republican candidate are colored red
    and states that voted for the Democratic candidate are colored Blue.  However
    choropleths are useful for displaying all sorts of information such as population counts,
    income distributions, crime rates, health/illness rates, etc. This
    package simplifies the creation of US state, county and zip choropleths by
    providing the user three functions: all_state_choropleth
    (?all_state_choropleth), all_county_choropleth (?all_county_choropleth) and all_zip_choropleth
    (?all_zip_choropleth).
    These functions -Render the maps using ggplot2 with a clean background, the
    brewer color scheme, optional state labels and strong state boundaries
    -Handle the bookkeeping which makes county-level choropleths challenging
    -Accept continuous values and an optional number of buckets. -Bucket sizes
    and scales are programmatically created to have an equal size
    -zip level choropleths are rendered as scatterplots
