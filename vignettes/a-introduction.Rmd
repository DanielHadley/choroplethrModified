### What is a Choropleth?

A choropleth is a map which 

  1. Shows geographic boundaries.
  2. Colors those regions based on some metric.

Choropleths are useful for visualizing data which has a strong spatial component.  For example, here is a choropleth that shows 2012 Population Estimates in US States:

```{r}
    library(choroplethr)
    data(df_pop_state)

    state_choropleth(df_pop_state)
```

### What is choroplethr? 

`choroplethr` facilitates the creation of choropleth maps in R. It does this in 3 ways.

1. It provides ready-made functions for easily creating 4 different maps:
  - For US States, see `?state_choropleth`.
  - For US Counties, see `?county_choropleth`.
  - For US ZIPs, see `?zip_map`. Note that due to the size of of rendering ZIP boundaries at a national level, `choroplethr` renders ZIP maps as colored scatterplots. This means that they are not technically choropleths, since the boundaries are not drawn.
  - For Country choropleths, see `?country_choropleth`.
2. It provides API connections to interesting data sources for making choropleths.
  - US Census American Community Survey (ACS). See `?get_acs_df'.
  - World Bank data via their API. See `?choroplethr_wdi`.
3. It provides a framework to facilitate creating choropleths from arbitrary shapefiles.
